## Gameplay

### Primary screen

Idea 1 (lazy) : 
The user is asked to enter the keyword that are printed on the screen. The faster you type the better.
There is a pre-defined number of keyword determined by the firewall security.
If you fail a keyword, the encryption will increase (so the player will see less).
`could get all the keyword from the source file ? or maybe from some js prototype function that includes a lot of them?`

Idea 2 : 
The user is prompted with a CLI.
The terminal only allow the "rm" command.
The command "rm" stands for "remove" and must take a parameters : a color.
There are diff√©rents lazer (colors) in the room that block you the exists.

The energy level correspond to the number of "remove" command available
The firewall level correspond to the number of lazer in the room.
The encryption level is a simple "hacker fog of war" that will block the vision on the players with 0 and 1.



### Secondary screen

This screen show the current state of the hacker inside the Space Station.

On the top left corner, there is a display of the complete map `maybe randomly generated`
On the top right corner, it will display several information :
- The current zone security level (difficulty of the level where the squad is)
- Firewall Level (sets the difficulty of the puzzle)
- Energy (sets the speed at which elements moves on screen : impact on the timer)
- Encryption (how much the player can see on the primary screen `put 0 and 1 green text on top of the screen !!!!!`)
