## Gameplay

### Primary screen


Idea 2 : 
The user is prompted with a CLI.
The terminal allow the "rm" command.
The command "rm" stands for "remove" and must take a parameters : a color.
There are différents lazer (colors) in the room that block you the exists.

The energy level correspond to the number of "remove" command available
The firewall level correspond to the number of lazer in the room.
The encryption level is a simple "hacker fog of war" that will block the vision on the players with 0 and 1.



### Secondary screen

This screen show the current state of the hacker inside the Space Station.

On the top left corner, there is a display of the complete map `maybe randomly generated`
On the top right corner, it will display several information :
- The current zone security level (difficulty of the level where the squad is)
- Firewall Level (sets the difficulty of the puzzle)
- Energy (sets the speed at which elements moves on screen : impact on the timer)
- Encryption (how much the player can see on the primary screen `put 0 and 1 green text on top of the screen !!!!!`)


## Bonus (!SPOILERS!)

### References to the IT/Gaming/InfoSec world

I tried to includes some references to the hacker/IT world.
Here is the list : 
- The commander name is Pychus (Ref to Tychus Findlay from StarCraft)
- The good old mighty "Military Grade Security™"
- Green text on black background, well you know.
- The command prompt: `Hunter2@Skynet[~]>`
  - Hunter2 : bash.org/?244321
  - Skynet : Terminator
- The computer info : 
  - CubeOs: Inspired by Qubes Os Security focused OS.
  - v1.33.7: So leet!
  - Kernel 5.1: We are ahead of the Linux mainline, so futuristic.
- On the winning screen, you are greated with some analysis. The name cor*n*ficker is heavyly inspired by conficker worm.  It's also not a worm but an earworm (Helicoverpa zea), so a worm for corn. CORN FACTS.
